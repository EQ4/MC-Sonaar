2) Use the appropriate external (Only for 32-bit Linux).

​​If you're on 64-bit you don't have to do anything.
If you're on 32-bit, rename "essentiaRT~.pd_linux32" to "essentiaRT~.pd_linux"


OSX:
———

Drop the "Pd" folder with the binaries, the examples and the utils in the Pd route. (i.e. ~/Library/Pd)

———————

Copy the all the dlls in the "/dependencies/win32" folder to one of the following:
