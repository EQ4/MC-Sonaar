PD:

Copy the all the dlls in the dependencies/win32 folder to either

- C:\Windows\System32
- The same folder that the essentiaRT~ resides in



Linux
=====

PD:

1) Install Dependencies 
You need to install the dependencies of Essentia (you don't actually need to build/install Essentia itself). Do this on Debian with:

sudo apt-get install build-essential libyaml-dev libfftw3-dev libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev python-dev libsamplerate0-dev libtag1-dev

2) Use the appropriate external (Only for 32-bit Linux)
If you're on 64-bit you don't have to do anything. If you're on 32-bit, rename "essentiaRT~.pd_linux32" to "essentiaRT~.pd_linux"
